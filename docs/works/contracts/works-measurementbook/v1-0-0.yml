          To create new Measurement Book in the system. API supports bulk creation with max limit as defined in the Measurement Book Request. Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Measurement Book, please pass array with one Measurement Book object.
          
          To create Measurement Book, the Letter of Acceptance/Work Order must be genarated and its offline status should be Work Commenced. There can be multiple measurement books for single Letter Of acceptance Estimate. Measurement books are not allowed to create once the Final bill is generated for Letter of Acceptance Estimate.
          
          The workflow will be there for measurement book. Save as drafts also required. Atleast one item Tendered Item or Non Tendered or Lump sum item is mandatory before submitting the Measurememnt Book. 
          
          Detailed Measurements needs to be captured for Measurement Book activities if there exists detailed measurements in estimate for the same activity.If Detailed Measurements are captured then the Cureent Entry Quantity at activity level will be defaulted from the computed value from measurements and not allowed to edit. Cureent Entry Quantity at activity can be directly entered if no measurements exists for the the Estimate/LOA activity.

Only the creator can edit all the fields when the Measurement Book in creator inbox(in Rejected status) or in drafts. 
          
          Auditing should be in place to keep track of the changes edited during the workflow.

Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Contractor Bill, please pass array with one Contractor Bill object.
          
          To create Contractor Bill, there should be one or more MB's in approved status where Bills are not created already for the same MB. There can be multiple Contractor Bills for the same MB in case of MB's having Part Rate flagged activities. Contractor Bills are not allowed to create once the Final bill is generated for Letter of Acceptance Estimate/Work Order.
          
          There can be more than one Part Bill for single Letter of Acceptance Estimate/Work Order. Only one Final bill will be there for single Letter of Acceptance Estimate/Work Order. Completion Date needs to be captured and Completion Certificate needs to be generated on Final Bill approval
          
          The workflow will be there for Contractor Bill. Save as drafts also required.
          
          The Debit account code is fetched from the Budget head of the correspodning Estimate. The Debit amount is the sum of the MB amount for which bill is created. The sum of debit and credit amount should be equal. There can be Statutory/Standard/Custom deductions along with Advance Adjustments and Retention Money deductions in contractor bill. The contractor net payeble account code will be fetched based on the purpose.
