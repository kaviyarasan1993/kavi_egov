      summary: Create new Letter Of Acceptance(s).
      description: |
          To create new Letter Of Acceptance in the system. API supports bulk creation with max limit as defined in the Letter Of Acceptance Request. Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Letter Of Acceptance, please pass array with one Letter Of Acceptance object.
          
          Letter Of Acceptance can be created for approved detailed estimate after L1 Tender finalized offline status set to Detailed Estimate.
          
          The Schedule A (SOR and Non SOR) selected while creating the detailed estimate will be populated in LOA as bill of quantity(BOQ).
          
          The the LOA number and Agreement date will be user entered in case of spillover work and auto generated in case of new work.
          
          Basic two steps workflow will be there for spillover LOA and new LOA will have multiple level workflow. The spillover LOA can be created on approved status or with work. Whether the LOA is spillover or not is decided based on the flag workOrderCreated from Abstract/Detailed Estimate.
