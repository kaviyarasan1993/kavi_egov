        summary: Get the list of catogery(s) or subcatogey(s) 
        description: |
          Search and get catogery(s) or subcatogey(s)  based on defined search criteria.
          Currently search parameters are only allowed as HTTP query params.
          
          In case multiple parameters are passed catogery(s) or subcatogey(s) will be searched as an AND combination of all the parameters.
          
          Maximum result size is restricted based on the maxlength of Category as defined in CategoryResponse model.
          
          1. To get All categories in the system, Paramters should be
              type -> CATEGORY
              categoryId -> null
          2. To get All SubCategories in the system , Paramters should be
              categoryId -> null
              type-> SUBCATEGORY
          3. To get SubCategories of a Given Category ex => id of catogery is 10, Paramters should be
            categoryId -> 10
            type-> SUBCATEGORY ( optional )
          
          In the above three cases, along with categoryId and type, other paramters ids,name,code are considered and queried with AND condition.  
            
          By default results will be sorted by Category/SubCategory Name

           **Validations Applied**
               1. ApplicationType and BusinessNature Existance
               2. CategoryId existance in the system
               3. SubCategoryId should exists and should belong to the category passed
               4. FeeType should belong the subCategory passed
               5. Financial Year existance
               6. Unique FeeMatrix with the combination of tenantId, ApplicationType, BusinessNature,categoryId, subCategoryId,financialyear,feeType
               7. FeeMatrix Details uomTo should be greater than uomFrom
               8. FeeMatrix Details First Record for a given FeeMatrix should have zero value for uomFrom
               9. FeeMatrix Details only Last Reocrd for a given FeeMatrix can have empty uomTO ( which indicates infinity)
               10. All FeeMatrixDetails for a given FeeMatrix should be in proper range sequence
           
           **Additional Manipulations**
              1. EffectiveFromDate for a given FeeMatrix will be populated by system as given FinancialYears startDate
              2. EffectiveToDate will be populated by system as :
                    1. NULL when there is no FeeMatrix in the system for a given tenant and with effectiveFromDate greater than current FeeMatrix FinancialYears endDate
                    2. If there is a FeeMatrix in the system for a given tenant and with effectiveFromDate greater than current FeeMatrix FinancialYears endDate, then effectiveToDate of current FeeMatrix will set as the identified FeeMatrix effectiveFromDate - 1 Day
              3. If there is a FeeMatrix in the system for a given tenant and with effectiveFromDate less than the current FeeMatrix effectiveFromDate, then update the identified FeeMatrix effectiveToDate to current FeeMatrix effectiveFromDate - 1 Day
